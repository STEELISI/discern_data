Average volume of data: 14.03 KB/s (influx & postgres)

Average volume of data without postgres instance: ~3.5 KB/s
    - This indicates we need a better way to store the logs
    - Postgres doesn't increase in size by a lot, but it has a very large overhead
        - 118 KB difference between smallest and largest postgres sizes
        - Min size: 252KB
    - Should look into reducing the postgres database image dumps
    - Need to analyze scaling with the # of nodes
